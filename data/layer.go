		When removing a vertex, we check the height of the triangle of the area
		being removed from the original polygon by the simplification. However,
		when consecutively removing multiple vertices the height of the previously
		removed vertices w.r.t. the shortcut path changes.
		In order to not recompute the new height value of previously removed
		vertices we compute the height of a representative triangle, which covers
		the same amount of area as the area being cut off. We use the Shoelace
		formula to accumulate the area under the removed segments. This works by
		computing the area in a 'fan' where each of the blades of the fan go from
		the origin to one of the segments. While removing vertices the area in
		this fan accumulates. By subtracting the area of the blade connected to
		the shortcutting segment we obtain the total area of the cutoff region.
		From this area we compute the height of the represenatative triangle
		using the standard formula for a triangle area: A = .5*b*h
